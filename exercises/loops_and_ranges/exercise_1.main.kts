/* DO PROGRAMMERS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Alan tries to fall asleep by counting 'electric sheep'.
 *
 * For any nth sheep, if n is even then Alan counts n in decimal. Otherwise, it is an electric
 * sheep and he counts n in binary. For example, Alan would count up to eight sheep as follows:
 *
 *     0 sheep, 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 11 sheep, 4 sheep, 101 sheep, 6 sheep, 111 sheep, 8 sheep
 *
 * Use a `while` loop to write a program that will print Alan's counting while he is awake.
 * The loop should stop when Alan falls asleep (when he reaches a count of ten).
 *
 *  HINT 1: You can use `Integer.toBinaryString(n)` to convert the integer `n` to a binary string.
 *  HINT 2: A number is even if its remainder after division by 2 is zero, e.g., 4 % 2 == 0.
